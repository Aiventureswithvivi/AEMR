<h1 style="color:#D4AF37"> What's the Business Problem? üí∞</h1>

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the United States of America‚Äôs domestic energy network. The regulator‚Äôs responsibility is to ensure that America‚Äôs energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions, which are known as outages. 

There are four key types of outages:

‚óè Consequential

‚óè Forced 

‚óè Opportunistic 

‚óè Planned 

The AEMR management team has been increasingly aware of a large number of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017 calendar years. The focus of this project is to analyze various types of outages reported by energy providers during the 2016 and 2017 calendar years. My primary objective in this project is to address two key concerns raised by the AEMR management team:

<b> A) Energy Stability and Market Outages
    <p>
B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability </b>

### SQL Techniques and Queries Overview
Throughout AEMR case study, I employed a range of SQL techniques to extract, analyze, and present data, simulating real-world data analysis tasks. Below is a summary of the key SQL techniques and types of queries utilized in this project:

1. Data Retrieval and Filtering:
    * SELECT Statements: Focused data retrieval by selecting specific columns.
    * WHERE Clauses: Filtered data based on specific conditions.
2. Data Aggregation:
    * GROUP BY Clauses: Aggregated data by categories for summary statistics.
    * Aggregate Functions: Used COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), and MAX() to analyze grouped data.
3. Data Sorting and Ranking:
    * ORDER BY Clauses: Sorted query results to prioritize information.
    * LIMIT Clauses: Restricted the number of records returned for top N analysis.
4. Subqueries and Nested Queries:
    * Subqueries: Broke down complex queries into manageable parts.
    * Nested SELECT Statements: Enabled multi-step data processing within a single query.
5. Data Integrity and Validation:
    * HAVING Clauses: Filtered aggregated data to ensure accurate results.
    * CASE Statements: Applied conditional logic to classify or assign values.
